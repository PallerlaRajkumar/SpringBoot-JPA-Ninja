# SpringBoot-JPA-Ninja
Spring Boot &amp; JPA backend demo: DI, IoC, JPA relationships (@OneToMany, @ManyToMany), Flyway migrations, dynamic queries (Criteria API), pagination, and transaction management. Solved N+1 problem with @EntityGraph. Built with Lombok, JPA Buddy, MySQL.




## ðŸš€ Spring Boot & JPA Backend Mastery  
A comprehensive Spring Boot project demonstrating dependency injection, IoC, Spring Data JPA, and advanced database interactions. Covers:  

âœ” Core Spring:  
- Dependency Injection (constructor/setter)  
- Bean scopes (`@Singleton`, `@Prototype`)  
- Externalized config (`application.properties`)  
- Lazy initialization & lifecycle hooks  

âœ” Database Integration:  
- JPA/Hibernate with `OneToMany`, `ManyToMany`, `OneToOne` relationships  
- Optimized queries (`@EntityGraph`, projections)  
- Flyway migrations & schema management  
- Solved N+1 problem  

âœ” Advanced Features:  
- Dynamic queries (Criteria API, Query by Example)  
- Pagination & sorting  
- Transactions (`@Transactional`)  

Tools: Spring Boot, Lombok, JPA Buddy, MySQL, Flyway.  

ðŸ”§ Perfect for:  
- Learning Spring Boot best practices  
- Reference for JPA relationship mappings  
- Debugging & performance optimization examples  

  

1. SEO-Friendly: Keywords like "Spring Boot JPA," "dependency injection," and "Flyway" help visibility.  
2. Structured: Groups features logically (Core â†’ DB â†’ Advanced).  
3. Actionable: Tells users what theyâ€™ll gain (learning, reference, debugging).  
4. Concise: Skimmable with bullet points and emojis.
